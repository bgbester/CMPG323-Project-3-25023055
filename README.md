# Branching Strategy with diagram
When we look at we can look at all 5 projects, we will have one main project with all the Mile Stones and tasks that will be linked to 4 different repositories and the 5 repositories will be split entirely from each other, we will fork a repository of the similarities are the same and we can save time. Please see the image below.

# Gitignore
We will use 1 single file per repository to save all the password information but will upload a dummy file so that anyone can change the password and username then everything will start working. The file will be called Autentication_Share, we will save all our details in the real Authentication file, but will not share it on Github, thus all the user has to do is rename the Authentication_Share file to the original name and everything should start working.

# Storage of credentials and sensitive information
We will store our authentication details in a text file, for now, we may move it to a database with all the details.

# Referencing used information
All the info I get from any 3rd parties will be referenced in the text and the links can be found in my referencing document found at CMPG323-Project-3-25023055/Referencing Document
